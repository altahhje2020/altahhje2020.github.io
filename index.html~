	<h3> To start you should get some string in your desired colors. Depending on the design you want to make you may need more or less colors or you may need to cut many strings of the same color. Once you have made you choice, cut them to about double the size of your armspan. This should be enough string. Lets say that you need two strings, if they are the same color, you can use only one. Folding the string in half and knotting it at the top will give you two strings and a little loop that will be handy in tying the bracelet on. </h3>
